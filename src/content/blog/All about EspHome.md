# ESP Home
ESPHome is an amazing platform that allows you to control ESP8266 and ESP32 devices through simple, YAML-based configuration files. With ESPHome, you can easily automate devices, set up sensors, and control lights, all without needing deep programming knowledge.

## ESPHome with Home Assistant

When paired with Home Assistant, ESPHome becomes even more powerful. Home Assistant provides an intuitive interface to control ESPHome devices and monitor them in real-time. Integrating ESPHome with Home Assistant allows seamless access to your device configurations, letting you build a fully connected and customizable home automation system.


## ESPHome Control RGB LED
![alt text](./images/esp/led-rgb.jpg)

In this project, the **Ambiance Controller** is designed to manage RGB LED lights to create custom lighting moods. With ESPHome, controlling RGB LEDs is straightforward. You can configure effects like fading, flashing, and color transitions, all accessible from Home Assistant's interface.

## Setting Up the YAML Configuration File

The core of an ESPHome setup is the YAML configuration file. This file tells ESPHome how to handle each connected device, including pin configurations, effects, and integration settings. Hereâ€™s a basic example YAML file for controlling an RGB LED with ESPHome:
